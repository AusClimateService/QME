# QME
Code for QME bias correction method

This repository contains the code for running the QME method, developed by Andrew Dowdy in IDL and translated to Python by Andrew Gammon for use by the ACS.

A simple example notebook has been provided, as well as an example Python script (with slightly more advanced application as it uses the account trend option) and an accompanying example PBS job submission if being run in the NCI environment (noting that it requires access to projects hh5 and dk92, and that it should be adjusted according to where data will be read and stored, and which project the job should be submitted under).
